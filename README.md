- 👋 Hi, I’m @Raphael
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and evolving constantly
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some personal projects and other projects that i'd find in github, helping with what i can help.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can send an email for me which is @rgrossi04@gmail.com, but please, don't send me suspicious links because i will not click on them.
- ⚡ Fun fact: the first language that i tried to lean was python when i was 14 years old, unfortunately i didn't learn almost anything 😄

<!---
